][LIMINAL][ Contour

## Description
We keep on creating and occupying spaces in our unconscious daily movements. In a massively compressed urban space like Hong Kong we constantly find ourselves reaching for the smallest available spots to advance through crowds. We try to achieve the highest mobility in a limited volume.
][LIMINAL][ Contour is an analysis sketch to visualizing people's movement in a Wan Chai, Hong Kong. A few seconds of time the same spot are compressed into a single frame.
