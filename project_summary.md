# Project Title
][LIMINAL][ Contour

## Authors
Kenny Wong (github:kennyviperhk)

## Description
We keep on creating and occupying spaces in our unconscious daily movements. In a massively compressed urban space like Hong Kong we constantly find ourselves reaching for the smallest available spots to advance through crowds. We try to achieve the highest mobility in a limited volume.
][LIMINAL][ Contour is an analysis sketch to visualising a typical day of people's movement in a Wan Chai, Hong Kong. A few seconds of time of the same spot are compressed into a single frame.
